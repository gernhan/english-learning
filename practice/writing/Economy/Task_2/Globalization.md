## 30-70 Answer

The global economy has witnessed remarkable transformations, prompting a debate on the effects of globalization. While proponents argue that globalization has boosted economic growth and enhanced living standards, opponents contend that it has widened income disparities and contributed to various social and environmental challenges.

Supporters of globalization highlight its role in fostering economic integration and facilitating international trade. They cling to that increased cross-border trade and investment have led to greater efficiency, productivity gains, and access to new markets, thereby driving economic growth. Moreover, globalization has enabled the transfer of technology and knowledge across borders, empowering developing countries to catch up with their more advanced counterparts.

Conversely, critics of globalization point to its negative consequences, particularly its exacerbation of income inequality. As multinational corporations seek to maximize profits, they often exploit cheap labor in developing countries, leading to lower wages and poor working conditions. This widening gap between the rich and the poor not only undermines social cohesion but also poses a threat to long-term economic stability.

Furthermore, globalization has been linked to environmental degradation and cultural homogenization. The pursuit of economic growth has resulted in increased resource extraction, pollution, and habitat destruction, posing significant threads to ecosystems and biodiversity. Additionally, the spread of Western consumer culture has eroded traditional values and cultural diversity in many societies.

In conclusion, globalization has undoubtedly reshaped the global economy, with both positive and negative consequences. While it has contributed to economic growth and development, it has also exacerbated income inequality and environmental degradation. To harness the benefits of globalization while mitigating its drawbacks, policymakers must prioritize inclusive and sustainable economic policies that promote equitable growth and protect environment.
