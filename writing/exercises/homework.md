## Session 1

The table shows the satisfaction of students in two high schools in 1990 and 2000. In general, students in school A became more satisfied while the statistics in school B witnessed an opposite pattern from 1990 to 2000. Another thing worth noting is that in virtually all subjects, students' contentment in school A was higher than that in school B.

Students in school A were most interested in biology with 60 percent satisfaction in 1990 and a 20 percent increase to 80 percent in 2000, the most significant increase of satisfaction in school A. Meanwhile, students in school B did not have much interest in this subject, with only 17 and 10 percent in 1990 and 2000, respectively. Students in school B were most satisfied with geography with 32 percent in 1990, which decreased to just 21 percent in 2000. Other statistics showed that there was no more than 25 percent of satisfaction in any subject in 2000 at school B. However, the most unsatisfying subject in school A was Mathematics with 30 percent which was still 5 percent higher than the most satisfying subject in school B, which was also Mathematics. 

## Session 2

1. The chart illustrates the different levels of further education qualifications in Australia and the proportion of males and females who held them in 1999. While the skilled vocational diploma was the most participated in among men, women mostly joined the undergraduate diploma. 

2. The graph illustrates the difference between the proportion of international and UK students gaining second class degrees or above at a major UK university. Except for electrical engineering and information technology, almost all fields witnessed higher percentages of UK students than those of international students.

3. The chart illustrates the number of males and females participating in full-time and part-time courses in post-school education in Britain in three periods. While males participated in part-time courses more often, females' figures for both types of studies increased over time from 1970/71 to 1990/91.  

4. The table shows how student income sources changed during the periods 1988/89, 1992/93, 1995/96, and 1998/99. While parent contribution became less important, other sources played an increasingly vital role over the periods from 1988/99 to 1998/99.   

5. The graph shows the amount of money spent on each student's education in California between 1989 and 2000. Students purchased more computers, and on the other hand, the spending on books decreased in general.

6. The charts show the levels of education in Glasgow, a city in Scotland, in 2010. People in the younger ages had higher education levels than the elderly, and in terms of male-female comparison, there were almost the same percentages for men and women.

7. The diagram illustrates the development stages of a small town in 1990, 1950, and 2000.

8. The first graph shows the car sizes sold in Australia from 1990 to 2008, while the second graph shows the price of petrol during this period.

9. The three pie charts show the pet types owned by 12-year-old children in Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

10. The diagram shows how increased carbon dioxide results in global warming.

11. The chart shows the life expectancy of men and women in five different countries around the world.

12. The line chart shows how serious violent crime was from 1978 to 2000 in the USA.

13. The charts show world population estimates and projections from the US Census Bureau.

14. The graphs show the overweight population in Britain in 2003 with projections for 2010.

## Session 3

TASK 1: train passengers and punctuality

```
The first graph shows the number of train passengers from 2000 to 2009. The second graph shows the percentage of trains running on time.

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.
```

The presented charts illustrate the fluctuations in the volume of train passengers and the punctuality rate of trains from 2000 to 2009. In general, there was a subtle upward trend in the number of rail passengers throughout the specified period. Likewise, the punctuality rate exhibited fluctuations, experiencing intermittent ups and downs but ultimately showing overall growth.

Commencing the timeframe with 40 billion passengers using trains for their transportations, the figures reached a pinnacle of roughly 49 billion in 2005, despite a slight dip in 2003. From 2005 to 2008, the passenger count gradually decreased by around 9 billion, rebounding to approximately 45 billion in the final year.
 
Throughout this period, the punctuality target constantly aimed for 95 percent. Initially starting at 92 percent in the first year, the rate witnessed significant growth, reaching 96 percent within the subsequent four years. Although experiencing a temporary decline of 4 percent from 2004 to 2006, the figure ascended once again, achieving a new peak of 97 percent in both 2008 and 2009.

Task 1: Pie charts: Class size

```
The pie charts show the size of classes in primary schools in four states in Australia in 2010.

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.
```

The charts provide a detailed analysis of primary school class sizes in four Australian regions in 2010. Generally, classes with `21-25` students dominated across all surveyed states, except for South Australia, where classes with fewer than 20 students were predominant. Conversely, classes with over 29 students were infrequent in these regions.

Examining New South Wales initially, it is noteworthy that 37% of primary-level classes in this state featured `21-25` students, closely followed by those with `26-30` students and fewer than 20 students at 33% and 26%, respectively. Conversely, in South Australia, the distribution of classes containing `26-30` students and 20 students or fewer varied from 28% to 36% respectively, with classes capped at 20 students emerging as the most favored. Notably, the proportions for the largest class size in both states were identical, each standing at a mere 4%.

Shifting focus to Australian Capital Territory, it is worth highlighting that classes comprised of `21-25` students constituted the majority, surpassing half of all listed class sizes. In contrast, 38% of classes accommodated no more than 20 students. This discrepancy was particular striking when compared to classes with `26-30` students, which comprised one-tenth of the total, marking a tenfold increase from the smallest size. Moving on to Western Australia, the prevailing class size remained consistent at `21-25` students, claiming 42% of the distribution. A marginal difference surfaced in the proportions of classes with under 20 students and those with `26-30` students, with figures of 26% and 27%, respectively. Trailing behind was the largest class size, representing a modest 5% share.
