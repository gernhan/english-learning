## Session 1

The table shows the satisfaction of students in two high schools in 1990 and 2000.

In general, students in school A became more satisfied while the statistics in school B drew an opposite picture from 1990 to 2000. Another thing worth to note is that in virtually all subjects, students' contentment in school A is higher than the one in school B.

Students in school A were most interested in Biology with 60 percent satisfaction in 1990 and 20 percent increment up to 80 percent in 2000. This is also the subject that witnessed the most significant increase of satisfaction in school A. Meanwhile, students in school B did not have much interest in this subject, with only 17 and 10 percent in 1990 and 2000 respectively. Surprisingly, students in school B were most satisfied with 32 percent in geography in 1990 which decreased to just 21 percent in 2000. Other statistics showed that there is no more than 25 percent of satisfaction in any subject in 2000 at school B. However, the worst subject in school A is Mathematics with 30 percent which is still 5 percent higher than the most satisfied subject in school B, which is also Mathematics again. 

## Session 2

1. The chart illustrates the different levels of further qualifications in Australia and the proportion of males and females held in 1999. While the skilled vocational diploma was the most interesting among men, women had the biggest interest in undergraduate diploma. 

2. The graph illustrates the difference between the proportion of international and UK students gaining second class degrees or above at a major UK university. Despite higher figures in Electrical engineering and Information Technology, almost all fields witnessed higher percentages for UK students than those for international students.

3. The chart demonstrates the number of males and females participating in full-time and part-time courses in post-school education in Britain in three periods. While males tend to participate in part-time courses more often, females' figures both increase over time from 1970/71 to 1990/91.  

4. The table reveals how student income sources changed during the period of ten years. While parent contribution played the most vital role in 1988/89 with 38 percent, other sources took the replacement of the largest proportion in 1998/99 holding 34 percent in 1998/99.   

5. The graph unveils the money spent on each student's education in California between 1989 and 2000. Students became more interested in computers, and as a result, the spending on books decreased in general.

6. The charts show the levels of education in Glasgow, a city in Scotland, in 2010. People in the younger ages tend to have higher education levels than the elders, and in terms of male-female comparison, there are almost the same percentages for men and women.

7. The diagram illustrates the development stages of a small town in 1990, 1950, and 2000.

8. The first graph shows the car sizes sold in Australia from 1990 to 2008, while the second graph reveals the price of petrol during this period.

9. The three pie charts show the pet types owned by 12-year-old children in Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

10. The diagram shows how increased carbon dioxide results in global warming.

11. The chart unveils the life expectancy of men and women in five different countries around the world.

12. The line chart indicates how serious violent crime was from 1978 to 2000 in the USA.

13. The charts show world population estimates and projections from the US Census Bureau.

14. The graphs summarize the Department of Heath's survey on the overweight population in Britain in 2003 with projections for 2010.
