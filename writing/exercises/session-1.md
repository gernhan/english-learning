## Session 1

The table shows the satisfaction of students in two high schools in 1990 and 2000. In general, students in school A became more satisfied while the statistics in school B witnessed an opposite pattern from 1990 to 2000. Another thing worth noting is that in virtually all subjects, students' contentment in school A was higher than that in school B.

Students in school A were most interested in biology with 60 percent satisfaction in 1990 and a 20 percent increase to 80 percent in 2000, the most significant increase of satisfaction in school A. Meanwhile, students in school B did not have much interest in this subject, with only 17 and 10 percent in 1990 and 2000, respectively. Students in school B were most satisfied with geography with 32 percent in 1990, which decreased to just 21 percent in 2000. Other statistics showed that there was no more than 25 percent of satisfaction in any subject in 2000 at school B. However, the most unsatisfying subject in school A was Mathematics with 30 percent which was still 5 percent higher than the most satisfying subject in school B, which was also Mathematics. 

## Session 2

1. The chart illustrates the different levels of further education qualifications in Australia and the proportion of males and females who held them in 1999. While the skilled vocational diploma was the most participated in among men, women mostly joined the undergraduate diploma. 

2. The graph illustrates the difference between the proportion of international and UK students gaining second class degrees or above at a major UK university. Except for electrical engineering and information technology, almost all fields witnessed higher percentages of UK students than those of international students.

3. The chart illustrates the number of males and females participating in full-time and part-time courses in post-school education in Britain in three periods. While males participated in part-time courses more often, females' figures for both types of studies increased over time from 1970/71 to 1990/91.  

4. The table shows how student income sources changed during the periods 1988/89, 1992/93, 1995/96, and 1998/99. While parent contribution became less important, other sources played an increasingly vital role over the periods from 1988/99 to 1998/99.   

5. The graph shows the amount of money spent on each student's education in California between 1989 and 2000. Students purchased more computers, and on the other hand, the spending on books decreased in general.

6. The charts show the levels of education in Glasgow, a city in Scotland, in 2010. People in the younger ages had higher education levels than the elderly, and in terms of male-female comparison, there were almost the same percentages for men and women.

7. The diagram illustrates the development stages of a small town in 1990, 1950, and 2000.

8. The first graph shows the car sizes sold in Australia from 1990 to 2008, while the second graph shows the price of petrol during this period.

9. The three pie charts show the pet types owned by 12-year-old children in Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

10. The diagram shows how increased carbon dioxide results in global warming.

11. The chart shows the life expectancy of men and women in five different countries around the world.

12. The line chart shows how serious violent crime was from 1978 to 2000 in the USA.

13. The charts show world population estimates and projections from the US Census Bureau.

14. The graphs show the overweight population in Britain in 2003 with projections for 2010.
