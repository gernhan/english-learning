### How to write an introduction

The table below gives information about the problems faced by children in two primary schools in 2005 and 2015.

→ We use:

- _Synonyms_

  - Show - Illustrate
    - 'Describe' is only used for subjects as people
  - The consumption of beef - beef consumption - the figure of beef/it - the amount of beef consumed
    - 'Consumption' has no synonyms. It contains 'amount' meaning inside it.
  - Spending for/on books - expenditure for/on books - the amount of money spent/expended on/for

  - Sale of golds = Gold sales = The amount of gold sold / The value of gold sold

  - Incidence of X disease = the rate of X disease = the number of X disease incidents/cases/rates

  - Unemployment rate = the percentage/proportion/rate of the unemployed = jobless rate.

  - The 18-25 age group = The 18-25 = people / Americans aged 18-25 = 18-25-year-old people/Americans

  - Abandon 'quantity', 'ratio'

  - With changes over time (Charts with trends)

    - The graph/chart shows/illustrates how S (change) + (time)

  - Without changes over time (Charts of comparison)

    - The chart compares N1 in terms of N2 + (time)

  - 1940 - 2040: will change/changed from 1940 with predictions until 2040

- _Grammar_

- _Order of information_:

  - A, B and C
  - B, A and C

- _Summary and Listing_
  - For example: In three countries - In the USA, Vietnam and China
  - Only use when the list's size is lesser than or equal to 4

Lately: related to the habits and frequency
Recently: not related to the habits and frequency

### Writing an overview

_It is noticeable that_ school A had _higher proportions_ of children all seven educational difficulties in both years. _However_, while school A managed to _reduce_ the incidence of most of the problems between 2005 and 2015, school B saw an overall _rise_ in the percentage of children who were struggling.

Things to include:

- The highest subjects, not the lowest ones
- The most significant trends
- The greatest differences/variations

Formulae:

- Sentence 1:

  - It is clear/evident/apparent/noticeable that S + V
  - It can be seen that S + V

- Sentence 2:

  - In addition, S+V
  - Additionally, S+V

  - [However, / Nevertheless, / In contrast, / On the contrary, ] S+V
  - Meanwhile, S+V

## Day 3

### Charts with trends

#### General approach

##### Step 1: 3Ws

- What
- Where
- When: Tenses

##### Step 2: Legends and Units

- Legends
- Units

##### Step 3: Trends and Features

- Overview:
  - Describe the most general trends, and if not then describe the most significant items in terms of changes.
  - For a single legend:
    - Describe the only trend or both trends.
    - If there is more than two trends, compare the first and the last points of the line for one trend only.
  - For multiple legends:
    - Describe the only trend or both trends.
    - If there is more than two trends:
      - If there is clear ranking among the legends, describe the global trend of the highest one.
      - If there is no clear ranking among the legends, describe the global trend with the most significant changes.
- Body: how to structure → analyze vertically or horizontally
  - Collect in 2 groups, in each group, items share some traits.
- Detail: how many sentences (7-9) or how deeply to dig in
  - Trends
  - Figures

* As many as the trends can be, as little as details is needed for each one of them.

#### Samples

##### U.S. Meat & Poultry consumption, per capita, boneless, by species.

- `Khái niệm duy nhất thì phải có ***the***`

- Overview:
  - Beef = highest - majority
  - Broilers: highest increase
- Body:
  - Vertically: choose 1976 to divide the graph into 2 parts
  - Horizontally:
    - Beef and Broilers
    - Pork and Turkey
  - Details: Choose points especially the ones at which some changes happen, or they are the minimum or maximum ones. The points are specific for each legend. It is unnecessary to reluctantly find common points.

| -------- | 1955 - 1976                                                 | 1976 - the end                                     |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Beef     | Increased sharply from 60 to a peak of 90 pounds per capita | decreased sharply to 50 pounds per person per year |
| Pork     | Fluctuated between 40 and 50 pounds                         | increased sharply to around 60 pounds              |
| Broilers | Increased slightly to around 25 pounds                      | almost no significant change                       |
| Turkey   | almost unchanged at under 10 pounds                         | almost no significant change                       |

#### Homework

## Day 4

### Building sentences structures

```
1. S + V_trend + adv + (prep + amount) + (time)
2. There + be + (a/an) + adj + N_trend + (prep + amount) + in + N_change + (time)
3. S + (experience/undergo/be subject to) + (a/an) + adj + N_trend + (prep + amount) + in + N_change + (time)
4. (N_time/N_place) + witness/see + (a/an) N_trend + (prep + amount) + in + N_change + (time)
5. (a/an) adj + N_trend + be + recorded + (prep + amount) + in + N_change + (time)
```

Priority:
1,2 → 5 → 3 → 4

### Prepositions

#### Trends

```
- increase/decrease (v) + (by + 5%/to + 5%/in + the unemployment rate) - climb, grow, rise
- increase/decrease (n) + (of + 5%/to + 5%/in + the unemployment rate) - decline, drop, fall

- peak/trough (v) + at
- peak/trough (v) + of

- remain (v) at

- fluctuate (v) between 40 and 50
- fluctuate (v) at around 45

- begin/start/commence (v) at/with/from
- finish/end (v) at/with
```

### Writing complex sentences

1. Before/After/Then

- Use simple present tense in all cases.

```
* After S1 + V1, S2 + V2
* S1 + V1 before S2 + V2
* S1 + V1, then S2 + V2
* S1 + V1 and then S2 + V2
```

2. `V-ing`

```
V1-ing/Having V1-Pp, S + V2
```

- Right case:

  - Increasing / Having increased dramatically by 6% from 2023 to 2304, unemployment rate experienced a drop to 6% in 3456.

- Wrong case:
  - Increasing dramatically by 6% from 2023 to 2304, there was a drop to 6% in the unemployment rate in Year 3.

3. Relative Clauses

```
S1 + V1 + N_(subject of changes) which <clause> then + V2
```

```
S1 + V1, after which <clause> S2 + V2
```

- Right case:

  - From 2023 to 2304, there was a dramatic increase of 6% in the unemployment rate which dropped to 6% in 2343.
  - The unemployment rate which increased dramatically by 6% from 2023 to 2323 then dropped to 6% in 2343.
  - The unemployment rate increased dramatically by 6% from 2023 to 2323, after which dropped to 6% in 2343.

- Wrong case:
  - The unemployment rate increased dramatically by 6% from 2023 to 2323 which then dropped to 6% in 2343.

4. Comparison

```
S1 + V1 while/whereas S2 + V2
S1 + V1. In/By contrast, /On the contrary, /On the other hand, /Meanwhile, S2 + V2

S1 + V1. Likewise, /Similarly, /In a similar way, S2 + V2
S1 + V2, similar to/like /the same as N_(subject of changes) which + V2
```

The consumption of beef increased sharply, similar to pork consumption which rose dramatically.
The consumption of beef increased sharply, similar to pork rising dramatically.

  → If governments want to develop their economy, there is often a trade-off between economic development and environmental protection

3. Informal expressions

- The fact that we develop the economy has resulted in a lot of waste and caused the Earth's ecosystem to suffer
  → The economic development has _resulted in_/_*released*_/_generated_ a huge amount of waste and _put pressure on_/_*damage*_ the Earth's ecosystem.

4. Phrasal Verbs

- We need to look into the source of problem in order to come up with feasible solution
  → We need to investigate the source of problem in order to come up with feasible solution
