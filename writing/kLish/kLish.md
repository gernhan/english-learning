## Day 3

### Charts with trends

#### General approach

##### Step 1: 3Ws

- What
- Where
- When: Tenses

##### Step 2: Legends and Units

- Legends
- Units

##### Step 3: Trends and Features

- Overview:
    - Describe the most general trends, and if not then describe the most significant items in terms of changes. 
    - For a single legend:
        - Describe the only trend or both trends.
        - If there is more than two trends, compare the first and the last points of the line for one trend only.
    - For multiple legends:
        - Describe the only trend or both trends.
        - If there is more than two trends:
            - If there is clear ranking among the legends, describe the global trend of the highest one.
            - If there is no clear ranking among the legends, describe the global trend with the most significant changes.
- Body: how to structure → analyze vertically or horizontally
    - Collect in 2 groups, in each group, items share some traits. 
- Detail: how many sentences (7-9) or how deeply to dig in
    - Trends
    - Figures
* As many as the trends can be, as little as details is needed for each one of them.
