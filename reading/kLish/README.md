## Day 3

### Tourism

#### Ecotourism

It is tourism that is ecologically and socially sustainable

**Ecologically sustainable**: This refers to practices, actions, or processes that do not cause harm or damage to the local environment. Ecological sustainability involves ensuring that human activities do not deplete natural resources, harm ecosystems, or disrupt ecological balance. It involves responsible stewardship of the environment to ensure its long-term health and productivity.

**Socially sustainable**: This pertains to practices, actions, or developments that do not adversely affect local cultures, communities, or societal structures. Social sustainability encompasses aspects such as preserving cultural heritage, respecting local traditions and customs, promoting social cohesion, and ensuring equitable access to resources and opportunities for all members of society. It involves fostering relationships and systems that support the well-being and resilience of communities over time.

In summary, both ecological sustainability and social sustainability are important principles that aim to promote balance, harmony, and resilience in environmental and social systems, respectively. They seek to ensure that human activities support the health and vitality of both natural environments and human societies for present and future generations.

- Today's Ecotourism term is sometimes used as a marketing tag or an advertising gimmick.

* Advance people's awareness and responsibility.

* Respect the sacred traditions.

**_To take something at face value_**: means to accept or believe something exactly as it appears, without questioning or analyzing it further. When you take something at face value, you accept it as true or genuine based solely on its outward appearance or initial presentation, without considering any hidden meanings, motives, or implications that may exist.

- This expression implies that the information or statement is accepted without deeper scrutiny or skepticism. It suggests accepting things as they appear on the surface, without delving into potential underlying complexities or nuances.

- For example:

  - "I took his apology at face value and didn't question his sincerity."
  - "She always takes everything at face value, never doubting people's intentions."

- Taking something at face value can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or overlooking important details, especially when deeper analysis or critical thinking is necessary.

**_Equitable tourism_**

**_Refrain from doing something_**

**_Borrow the Earth from our children_**
