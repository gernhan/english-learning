## The Temple of Literature

The Temple of Literature, renowned as the Imperial Academy, stands as a pivotal historical landmark in Vietnam's cultural realm.
It embodies Vietnam's rich educational heritage, serving as a powerful symbol of reverence for educators and the pursuit of knowledge.

In terms of architecture, the structure is built in Vietnam's distinctive architectural style, instantly recognizable and impossible to confuse with any other.

I will take you to the place of worship of Chu Van An, an iconic figure in Vietnam's education system.
He was not only an educator who nurtured talented individuals for the nation but also a shining example of wholehearted service to the motherland throughout his life.

Finally, we arrive at the area where the stone `stele` honor the scholars who excelled in national examinations and contributed significantly to the construction and development of our country.
These `stele` are placed atop turtle backs, a sacred creature in our nation's culture.

Let's soak in the sacred atmosphere of this place before moving on to our next destination, the Hanoi Museum of Arts.
